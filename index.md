Hello! I am currently a PhD Candidate advised by Nolan Kane in the EBIO Department of University of Colorado, Boulder. I am studying evolutionary genomics of plants including flax (*Linum*), sunflower (*Helianthus*) and *Cannabis sativa*. My dissertation research is mostly focused on describing population genetic diversity and the evolutionary history of Lewis flax (*L. lewisii*) and some of its close relatives. This work is in collaboration with Brent Hulke (USDA-ARS, North Dakota State University) and will support an effort to domesticate this species as a new perennial oilseed crop. I have a separate [project](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.22.537924) that looks at the role of alternative splicing in adaptive divergence of sunflower ecotypes. I am broadly interested in the genetics of adaptation, hybridization, and domestication, and the evolution of gene regulation, especially as they pertain to conservation and sustainable agriculture.
