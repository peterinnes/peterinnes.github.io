I am a PhD student in Nolan Kane's lab at CU Boulder studying evolutionary genomics of crop wild relatives, including flax (*Linum*) and sunflower (*Helianthus*). My dissertation research is focused on describing population genetic diversity and the evolutionary history of Lewis flax (*L. lewisii*) and some of its close relatives. This work will support an effort to domesticate this species as a new perennial oilseed crop. I am broadly interested in the genetics of adaptation, hybridization, and domestication, especially as they pertain to conservation and sustainable agriculture.
